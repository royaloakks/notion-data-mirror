What’s the most critical that can be said?
A simple approach to learning how to solicit and receive feedback: Begin by showing a well-meaning peer someone else’s novel, painting, design or business plan… We don’t need unwarranted criticism or simple reassurance. In fact, we need someone who understands genre and has the insight to share what they know in a way we can use.

### Nathan Baugh

- Language: JRR Tolkien invented 15 languages for his books. Create phrases that become so common for your audience they associate them with you or your brand. It’s like inside jokes – shared lingo that only makes sense in your world.
  - iMessage = Apple: Apple owns the ‘i’ in front of its products. No other brand can use that without Apple first coming to mind.
  - wingardium leviosa = Harry Potter: I went to a wedding where the couple exited through everyone holding sparklers. I heard at least five people say this Latin-derived hodgepodge JK Rowling invented 20 years ago. That’s powerful.
- Rituals: Tolkien gave each of the different cultures he created their own customs and rituals. People function in this way. Shared rituals make us feel part of a group.
  - Crumbl Cookies: Each week, Crumbl releases a new lineup of six cookies to replace last week’s lineup. This creates a sense of anticipation (Crumbl fans look forward to the drop), a sense of urgency (if you don’t buy that kind of cookie this week, you may never again have the chance), and a sense of togetherness (the launch posts get hundreds of thousands of likes on IG and TikTok).
  The Story
  1. Call To Adventure: The Hero — appeal to deeply held beliefs about the human condition, like drive for success and persistence through adversity
  1. Victory Over Crisis: The Hero’s struggle to overcome adversity, fighting against their foes, competitors, detractors — the wise sage guides them through. First the Hero resists it (It’s not for me), but finally they heed the call for adventure and they face their fears (foes, competitors, detractors), the hero survives and triumphs.
  1. Transformation: The Hero’s story doesn’t end with triumph, they must be transformed long-term. Look to the enduring benefits of The Hero and the emotions they inspire in people.
  ### Robert McKee

  The Purpose-Told Story: 8 Stages
  1. The Targets
    Before considering our story, we must understand our:
    - Target Audience: who we’re talking to
    - Target Need: what problem they have that we can solve
    - Target Action: What we want them to do
    Without defining these three we’re guessing
  1. Subject Matter
    The constraints and subjects that make up our story:
    - Core Value: the value our brand couldn’t exist without
    - Protagonist: the hero our audience empathises with
    - Setting: society, time and place
  1. The Inciting Incident
    Launch the story by throwing the protagonists story out of whack
    Our goal is two-fold:
    - Grab your audience’s attention 
    - Propel the protagonist to action
    “fine storytellers seek out the negative side of life”
  1. The Object of Desire
    An unfulfilled need the protagonist feels the need to get their life back on track.
    That happens to be fulfilled by our product / service
    the most compelling objects come with a high price tag, a high price to entry.
  1. First Action
    The tactical choice the protagonist makes to re-balance their life.
    This cannot succeed. That’d be too easy.
    Introduce antagonists – anything keeping the protagonist from the object of desire
  1. The First Reaction
    The reaction to the First Action should be different or more powerful than expected. 
    This gap in expectation vs reality leaves space for the protagonist to gain insight.
    Two key aspects:
    - Violation of expectations
    - Turning points
  1. Crisis Choice
    The moment of truth – this final action must be more risky than the first.
    It’s now or never.
    The protagonist will either re-balance their life or remain in chaos.
  1. Climatic Reaction
    The protagonist gets their life back on track.
    Neuroscientists find the brain’s response to a good story’s climax is a few seconds of heightened memory.
    McKee recommends putting your logo right after the climax to take advantage of this. 
  Start With The End – the audience, their problem and the desired action.
  Then Figure Out The Beginning – the event to trigger the story.
  Lastly – build the narrative arc to connect the beginning to end

# 💡 Fan-Centric Artist Branding

Customer-Based Brand Equity (Keller, 1993)
- Level 1: Make the artist stand out. The first step is to create brand awareness. People should be able to recognise and identify the artist. This step is harder than it may seem: Most brands never move further from this step.
- Level 2: Build the artist’s image. Next, artists should know and communicate what they mean to fans and what the artist’s brand stands for. The brand’s benefits come to mind here.
- Level 3: Manage the fan’s judgements and feelings. Then, artists should understand how they make fans feel and how fans judge them. This should be aligned with the artist’s brand positioning and the main associations they focus on in their marketing strategy.
- Level 4: Build strong emotional connections with fans. Finally, when fans feel deeply connected with the artist's brand, artists should invest in a community ecosystem where fans could engage in meaningful interactions between the artist and their fans and between fans.
# 💡 The Brand Knowledge Model

Functional benefits relate to the brand’s problem-solving or problem-removal capabilities. They represent the intrinsic advantages of consuming the brand. For example:
- I listen to [artist brand] because it helps me focus.
- I listen to music to stimulate me during my workout.
Experiential benefits or emotional benefits relate to what it feels like when using the brand. For example:
- Listening to [artist brand] makes me feel happy/sad.
- When I see [artist brand] on Instagram I feel empowered.
Symbolic benefits relate to the brand’s extrinsic, non-product-related advantages, such as social approval and self-expression. Most artist brand positioning focuses on this. For example:
- I wear a [artist brand] t-shirt to show that I belong to this fan base.
- I post this music on my stories to show I’m always the first with new music.
Analysing the symbolic benefits of a brand gives information about a fan’s identity and the niche, scene and/or community they surround themselves with.
K.L. Keller – Conceptualizing, Measuring, and Managing Customer-Based Brand Equity (1993)
## 💡 Fanbases Making A Social Impact – PACT Model (Tory Fairies)

1. Product: Activate your community to share or donate your product or service. For decades, airlines have been leveraging this model by empowering travelers to donate their frequent flier miles to organizations like Make-A-Wish. Retailer Madewell recently launched a program where loyal customers can drop off pre-worn jeans at a local store to be repurposed into housing insulation, and they reward their customers’ good deeds with a $20 store credit.
1. Advocacy: Activate your community’s collective voice to draw attention to the issue areas your company impact strategy is championing. Call on them to sign petitions, circulate social media campaigns, and show up for change. Bobbie baby formula, a former client of mine, activated their community of parents to call their representatives to urge them to pass legislation to combat the Black maternal mortality crisis and rallied parents to march at the Capitol to demand legislative reform after 2022’s infant formula crisis.
1. Contributions: Activating your community to give funds is one of the most common ways companies engage, and when done right, can be an effective way to double your organization's impact. Clearly communicate your company’s skin in the game through a match or corporate contribution, and work together toward a time-bound, right-sized goal (whether that’s raising $1k or $10M). You’re likely to hear a classic example of this type of campaign on your daily commute when your local public radio station is doing a fund drive (“If callers help us reach our goal of raising $1,000 in the next hour, a local partner will match your effort, dollar for dollar!”).
1. Time & skills: Activating your community’s time can be as simple as inviting them to roll up their sleeves and volunteer alongside your employees for a service project. To tap further into the skills your community has to offer, ask if they have a unique skill they can offer your nonprofit partners. LinkedIn leverages its technology to make it easy for community members to indicate their willingness to join nonprofit boards.
Artist Application
- Product - Activate fans to donate an artist’s work. For example, give fans the opportunity to buy an extra ticket for a show and donate these tickets to fans with a lower income or refugees.

### Select a Focus

Decide on the specific online community, platform, or digital trend you want to study. It could be a social media platform, a niche forum, or a trending hashtag.
UK Rap as a genre and community of fans
### Define Your Research Question

Clearly articulate what you want to learn or investigate through your Netnography. What aspects of the online space do you find intriguing or relevant to your interests in music, marketing, or psychology?
What is driving music discovery in UK Rap?
What are the prominent brands (clothing, footwear, tech, social) that a close affinity within UK Rap?
What other forms of entertainment are talked about within UK Rap, IE Top Boy as a series?
What language and terminologies are used within the UK Rap community of fans and artists?
What TikTok or Instagram curators / influencers are having the most impact on music discovery in UK Rap
What Sub-Reddit pages are most influential when it comes to UK Rap? Are there any specific Reddit users with consistent enough posts that are influential in new music discovery within UK Rap?
### Data Collection

Gather data by observing online conversations, posts, comments, and interactions within the chosen digital space. This might involve using data scraping tools, monitoring software, or manual data collection.
Focus on TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, X, YouTube for influencers and curators
Analysis: Analyze the data to uncover patterns, behaviors, and insights. Look for recurring themes, emerging trends, and user behaviors that align with your research question.
Participant Observation: If possible, actively participate in the online community to gain a deeper understanding. Engaging with the community can provide valuable firsthand insights.
Ethical Considerations: Remember to respect privacy and ethical guidelines when conducting Netnography. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and anonymize any data you use.
Documentation: Keep detailed records of your findings, observations, and any noteworthy interactions. This documentation is crucial for the analysis and reporting phase.
Reporting and Sharing: Once you've completed your Netnography, write up your findings. Share your insights with peers, colleagues, or your target audience, which can be valuable in the context of marketing and trends analysis.
Stay Updated: Online communities and digital trends can evolve quickly. To stay relevant, continue to monitor and update your Netnography as needed.
Resources: You can find various books and academic papers on Netnography to help you deepen your understanding of the method.


### Fan Journey

- **Status**: Draft
- **Stage**: Define / Design

Acquisition; Activation; Retention; Revenue; Referral
- Acquisition: how do people discover you & your music, so Discovery.
- Activation: how do people engage with you, so Engagement.
- Retention: how will people show repeat engagement over time?
- Revenue: where do people spend money directly on you? Merch, tickets?
- Referral: how do people tell others about you? Social, word of mouth?
### Fan Journey Framework

Step One: Get discovered by new fans
write down all the likely places people might discover your music, be they friend recommendations (through which medium?), recommendation engines (what platforms?), social media e.g. through people sharing your posts, radio airplay (where?), playlists (which? platform?), etc. Try to identify the most important ones today that will still be important 6 months from now.
Step Two: Engage acquired fans
For the sake of this example fan journey, let’s say the next step from Discovery is that people Google you on their way to Engagement. What do they Google? If they’ve seen you in a playlist, they might Google your name. If they heard your latest song on the radio, your lyrics or a misspelling of your name. Try it out and see what the search results are like. Will they have to type “music” next to your name to find you as an artist? What are the first results? Note down what you’d ideally like to see here.
A very common Google search results page order for more established artists is: a carousel of videos at the top, then Wikipedia, then your YouTube channel, then your homepage.
If the video carousel is showing, click the top left video. If it’s not, go to your most viewed YouTube video, which is usually the one in these results. The very first result on search pages tends to get the most traffic. It should now be clear for people how they can follow you on YouTube as well as on another platform, such as Instagram. If not, take notes, so you can improve this.
Next, click your Instagram link from the video description. Landing on your Instagram profile, be super critical: how enticing is it? Is it clear to people what they get when they follow you? Does it invite people to engage?
### Step Three: Retain existing fans

Once people follow you, recurring engagement (aka retention) will depend on your content calendar. Keep this goal in mind when working on your schedule.

### Culture Research Techniques
- **Theme / Topic**: Culture, Community
- **Type**: Research
- **Status**: Draft
- **Stage**: Discover

RUMBLE CREATIVE BRIEF
- What is the objective of the piece?
What does the communication aim to achieve? Are there hard objectives? Like generating leads? Or driving sales? Is there a specific benchmark that needs to be achieved? Like achieving a 20% response rate? Or are the objectives softer? Announcing a new product for instance? Whatever the objective, make it concrete and specific. Who are you talking to?
Paint a picture of the target audience. Their needs, desires and wants. As well as the things they don't like, don't care for or don't want.
- What do they currently think about your product or service?
Do they like it? Trust it? Prefer it over other, similar offerings? Or do they currently have issues with the product? Barriers that stop them from buying it?
- What do you want them to think?
What mind shift do you want to create? What transformation? What words would you like to hear from the customer's mouth after they have read our communication?
- What features and benefits do we want the audience to hear about?
What specifics about our product or service will create interest, create resonance and create desire?
- What do you want our audience to do?
Is a response required from the communication? Do you want people to order from you? Or do you want to drive them to a physical location? An online store perhaps? Do you want them to download a voucher? Or are you simply writing to them to say thank you for their support?
Perhaps you want to convey a brand message?
- What's the single most important promise you are making?
There may be many messages you want to get across in your communication. But you need to choose the most important one. The one that is going to solicit the most impactful response. Please avoid using 'and' in your promise. The use of the word means there are two separate thoughts in your promise.
- Why should they believe this?
Your promise should be supported by facts, benefits and features. Work out what they are and list them in order of importance.
- What mandatories need to be included in the communication?
What are the messages, images, logos, assets and legal disclaimers that need to be included?
To conduct a cultural study, consider these key observations:
1. Social Customs: Observe daily rituals, greetings, and social interactions within the community.
1. Language and Communication: Analyze language nuances, verbal and non-verbal communication, and any unique expressions or idioms.
1. Traditions and Celebrations: Explore local festivities, holidays, and traditional ceremonies to understand their cultural significance.
1. Arts and Entertainment: Examine local arts, music, dance, and entertainment forms as expressions of cultural identity.
1. Cuisine and Eating Habits: Study local food customs, traditional dishes, and the role of meals in social contexts.
1. Beliefs and Values: Understand the community's religious beliefs, moral values, and any guiding principles shaping their worldview.
1. Clothing and Fashion: Note traditional attire and how it reflects cultural norms, identity, and societal roles.
1. Architecture and Urban Planning: Analyze the design of buildings, public spaces, and infrastructure, as they often reflect cultural preferences.
1. Historical Context: Consider historical events and their impact on the community's identity, values, and traditions.
1. Technology and Innovation: Explore how technology is integrated into daily life and whether it influences cultural practices.
Remember to engage with the community, ask open-ended questions, and approach the study with cultural sensitivity. It's crucial to adapt your methods based on the specific context of the culture you're studying.
For a cultural study of UK rap, apply the principles as follows:
1. Lyrics and Language: Analyze the lyrics for slang, regional accents, and cultural references, reflecting the linguistic diversity within the UK rap scene.
1. Live Performances and Events: Attend concerts and events to observe the audience, fashion trends, and the overall atmosphere surrounding UK rap performances.
1. Artistic Expression: Explore the visual aspects of album covers, music videos, and promotional materials to understand how artists express their cultural identity.
1. Collaborations and Features: Examine collaborations between UK rap artists and other musicians, identifying cross-genre influences that contribute to the cultural tapestry.
1. Social Media and Online Communities: Study how UK rap artists engage with fans on social media platforms, forums, and online communities, reflecting the digital influence on cultural expression.
1. Fashion and Style: Observe the fashion choices of UK rap artists, considering how clothing and style contribute to their individual and collective cultural identity.
1. Narratives and Storytelling: Analyze the narratives within UK rap songs, exploring themes of identity, social issues, and cultural pride.
1. Local Influences: Investigate how regional influences shape the sound and themes of UK rap, acknowledging the diversity within the country.
1. Historical Roots: Understand the historical context that has influenced the evolution of UK rap, considering socio-political factors and the genre's roots in the UK's multicultural landscape.
1. Technological Innovation: Explore how technology, especially social media and streaming platforms, has impacted the production, distribution, and reception of UK rap music.
Engaging with the UK rap community, attending events, and connecting with artists and fans will provide valuable insights for a comprehensive cultural study of the genre.

### Word of Mouth

I believe our fans and followers are those which will help us acquire new fans. If there’s a group of 10 friends and 6 of them are fans, the greatest opportunity we have of converting those other 4 are the 6 fans already bought in. Even then let’s apply a 20% variance, we can’t ever convert everyone, so we only need to win over another two of the friends. 6 vs 2 feels like good odds. Essentially what we’re saying is Word of Mouth, as un-revolutionary as that concept sounds. 
“People don't believe what you tell them. They rarely believe what you show them. They often believe what their friends tell them. They always believe what they tell themselves.” -Seth Godin
I believe art gives a voice to the voiceless. It allows us to express ourselves in ways we find difficult. To tell someone how we feel. When you find two or more people who come together because of music in sharing a voice then that’s powerful. Underdog stories that speak truth to power, communicate love when we can’t say it ourselves, it gives strength. It pushes up against the accepted way of doing things, it’s non-conformist, it makes our world more colourful and rich. It inspires conversation and debate, one tiny little song can literally change the course of someone’s life. 
If I can play a small part in that journey by playing around with imaginative and creative ideas that help contextualise and communicate an artist and song to people then that brings me immense fulfilment. 
Starting with what you believe is a helpful precursor to finding out your WHY. 
Art is enduring - institutions, money, laws, power, these have and will continue to change, yet we look at a picture or hear a song that has continued to be appreciated across generations of these changes. 
Yasiin Bey quote 
But it can be enduring on a personal level. It’s transformative - the emotional attachment we form with a 3 minute piece of music can make us feel 18 again. It brings us back to last summer or 25 summers ago. The people we were with the the places we’ve been. Or the places it will take us - the confidence it gives us to see what world is possible, for us and for everyone.

## Application Questions

When selling, the temptation is to focus on the mushroom—talk about its merits, features, and attributes. But this is what everyone does, so there’s no alpha there. You have to zig when they zag! You’re much better off focusing on Big Mario—the person that your potential customer will become after your product or service:
Superpowers they will suddenly possess.
Pains they will avoid.
Wealth they will accumulate.
Status they will garner.
a brand's role is often that of the mentor. The customer is the hero
How to tell your brands story:
1. Position the customer as the hero
1. Position the brand as the wise mentor helping the hero along.

# 🎯Streaming Growth Framework

How to turn fan intent into sustained algorithmic momentum
## 🔹 TIER 1: Fan Intent Signals

Most Direct Impact
These are the strongest early predictors of algorithmic growth and segment conversion — especially when stacked in Week 1.
Ref: 📌 Hands Up In The Sky had low total listeners but high intent ratios — now showing algorithmic lift.
## 🔹 TIER 2: Downstream Engagement Surfaces

Reinforcement Layer
These don’t create intent — they amplify and retain it.
Ref: 📌 Losing Control had 45–50% of streams from Collection + Search.
## 🔹 TIER 3: Initial Exposure Channels

Enablers, Not Drivers
These boost visibility, but don’t trigger long-term growth unless paired with intent signals.
Ref: 📌 Supersonic had 46% editorial share but just 6.5% Save Rate — reach without retention.
## 🔹 TIER 4: Creative / Marketing Execution

Levers to Trigger Tier 1 & 2 Signals
These actions influence the signals that matter — through targeting, messaging, and creative decisions.
## 🧠 Synthesised Insight: What Drives the Flywheel

### Ideal Track Journey

1. Reach
  Editorial, TikTok, fanbase, spark ads and content boosts
  ↓
1. Save, Add, Replay
  High per-listener engagement in Week 1
  ↓
1. Collection & Search
  Listeners actively returning
  ↓
1. Algorithmic Pickup
  Spotify responds in Week 2+
  ↓
1. Segment Growth
  Super / Moderate listeners increase
  ↓
1. Looped Exposure
  Algorithm + fandom reinforce each other
## 🧭 Expanded Ideal Track Journey

A high-performing song doesn’t just go viral — it follows a sequence where fan behaviour trains the algorithm.
### 1. Initial Reach (Pre-Release + Week 1)

The moment people first hear the track — before Spotify’s algorithm gets involved.
Includes:
- Spotify Editorial Playlists (e.g. New Music Friday, New Dance)
- TikTok virality (organic or Spark Ads)
- Fanbase marketing (presaves, Discord campaigns, email newsletters, direct messages)
- Influencer co-signs or reposts
- Journalistic press (Dazed, Resident Advisor, etc.) — indirect but can spark discovery
- Radio premieres / SoundCloud drops / YouTube trailers
Key Goal:
Drive targeted reach to high-intent listeners likely to save, replay, or add the track — not just passive exposure.
> ❌ Reach without engagement = wasted discovery

> ✅ Reach + Save/Add/Replay = algorithm-ready audience

### 2. Early Intent Signals (Week 1–2)

This is when Spotify starts listening to listener behaviour.
Signals that matter most:
- Saves (volume)
- Playlist Adds
- Replay Ratio (Streams : Listeners)
- Save-to-Listener %
- Add-to-Listener %
These signals feed Spotify’s relevance models (esp. on release radar and daily mix inclusion). High volume + high ratios = greenlight for algorithmic promotion.
> 📌

  Losing Control
### 3. Downstream Engagement Surfaces (Week 2+)

How listeners behave when they return to the track organically.
Key surfaces:
- Collection Streams (from their saved library)
- Search Streams (actively looking for the track again)
- Play Queue / Repeat Plays
These are some of the most predictive signals of long-tail retention and algorithmic eligibility for Discover Weekly, On Repeat, Your Top Songs, etc.
> 📌 Tracks with strong Collection/Search behaviour tend to enter long-tail algorithmic loops.

### 4. Algorithmic Pickup (Week 2–3)

If fan behaviour is strong, Spotify responds by pushing the track algorithmically.
Algorithms likely activated:
- Discover Weekly
- Radio
- On Repeat
- Daily Mixes
- Genre/Contextual Autoplay
Expect uplift in:
- Algorithmic stream count
- Algorithmic share (% of total)
- Repeat listener conversion (Moderate → Super)
> 📈 Both

  Losing Control
  Hands Up
### 5. Segment Deepening (Week 3–4)

Your fanbase is now stratifying into Super, Moderate, and Light listeners.
Key conversions to track:
- Growth in Super listeners
- Reduction in Light % (means retention is working)
- Share of total streams from Collection + Autoplay
- Active engagement on artist profile or future releases
This is the foundation for:
- Ticketing
- Merch conversion
- Future release anticipation
### 6. Recirculation via Fandom or Algorithm (Week 4+)

The track either fades, or loops back into circulation.
Triggers:
- New influencer moment / viral usage


### Streaming Data Principles

# 🎯 Streaming Data Principles

A strategic playbook for understanding and improving streaming performance across releases.
These principles are drawn from Marlon Hoffstadt’s catalogue but designed as a diagnostic lens for other artists. Benchmarks should be calibrated by genre, scale, and audience maturity.
## 🧠 Core Framework: The 3S Flywheel

A repeatable model for organic streaming growth:
Save → Replay → Collection → Algorithmic Uplift
Spotify interprets these signals as:
- Save = intent to revisit
- Replay Ratio = reinforced interest
- Collection/Search = emotional commitment
- Together, they train Spotify’s algorithm to expand reach
## 🔍 Key Correlation Insights

Save Rate (%)
- Moderately correlated with Replay Ratio (+0.45)
- Strongly negatively correlated with Editorial Streams (–0.82), Streams (–0.53), and Listeners (–0.67)
  Conclusion: Save Rate = quality per listener, not scale. High exposure often lowers Save Rate, while fan-driven releases trend higher.
Stream-to-Listener Ratio (Replay Ratio)
- Correlates positively with Save Rate (+0.45), Playlist Adds (+0.36), Algorithmic Streams (+0.25)
  Conclusion: Replay is the clearest proxy for love. Tracks above 2.0x see stronger Week 2 algorithmic growth.
Playlist Adds & Saves (Volume)
- Most predictive of Week 2 Algo: Adds (r = +0.93), Saves (r = +0.92)
- Strong correlation with Listener Segment conversion: Save-to-Listener % (+0.96), Playlist-to-Listener % (+0.97)
  Conclusion: Raw Saves/Adds = scale predictors. Per-listener ratios = depth predictors.
Collection Streams
- Strong correlation with total saves (+0.84), weak correlation with Save Rate (+0.04)
  Conclusion: Raw save volume drives Collection use. Collection = intent activated.
Super Listener % (Standalone)
- Strongly correlated with Week 2 Algo Growth:
  - Losing Control & Hands ≥5% → uplift
  - Supersonic & Daddy’s ≤3% → no uplift
- Correlates with Save %, Playlist %, Replay Ratio
  Conclusion: Super Listener % is the emotional truth metric. If core fans don’t care, the algorithm won’t push further.
The Editorial Trade-Off
- Editorial negatively correlates with Save Rate (–0.82), Replay Ratio (–0.29), Super % (–0.76)
  Conclusion: Editorial = reach, not intent. Ideal balance: Editorial < Algo + Collection.
## 🧠 Fan Behaviour Loops

Fan Experience A: Replay → Save → Collection → Return
→ Spotify sees this as real-time engagement stacking
Fan Experience B: Save → Return → Replay → Add to Playlist
→ Spotify sees this as proactive fandom
These loops illustrate how Save, Replay, and Collection stack to trigger Week 2 uplift.
## 🔁 The Flywheel in Action: Case Studies

🔥 Losing Control
- Week 1 Saves: 79.5K
- Replay Ratio: 2.31x
- Collection Share: 27.4%
- Week 2 Algo: 528K (+63%)
- Editorial Share: <17%
  Outcome: Strongest performer across all metrics.
🔥 Hands Up In The Sky
- Save Rate: 16.4%
- Replay Ratio: 2.29x
- Collection Share: 26.7%
- Week 2 Algo: 51K (+56%)
  Outcome: Lower scale but high per-listener intent = long-tail uplift.
⚠️ Supersonic / Daddy’s In The Club
- Despite high saves & adds, intent was diluted (low Save Rate, Replay, Super %) 
- Both declined algorithmically in Week 2
## 🎯 Strategic Takeaways

1. Activate core fans first
  Super Listener % is the most decisive metric — without early fan love, Week 2 algorithmic growth won’t happen.
1. Push for replay, not just reach
  Content and campaigns should drive repeat listening (Replay Ratio ≥2.0x) rather than one-off streams.
1. Make Saves and Adds work harder
  Raw volume unlocks scale, but only if fans return. Pair presaves with tactics that convert into Collection use and replays.
1. Balance exposure with engagement
  Editorial boosts visibility, but Spotify responds more strongly to Collection + Algorithmic streams. Don’t let passive reach drown out intent.
1. Use paid boosts where intent is high but reach is low
  Spark Ads or targeted pushes are most efficient on tracks with strong Save/Replay signals but modest audience size.
## ✅ Ideal Week 1 Benchmarks

## ✍️ Case Study: Marlon Hoffstadt

## 🔁  Marlon Hoffstadt – Week 2 Algorithmic Streams

## 📈 Marlon Hoffstadt – Losing Control Week 1

## 📈 Marlon Hoffstadt – Hands Up In The Sky Week 1

## 📉 Wk 1 vs Wk 2 — Daddy’s In The Club

## 📉 Wk 1 vs Wk 2 — Supersonic

## 📉 Marlon Hoffstadt – Supersonic & Daddy’s In The Club (Week 1)

## ⚠️ Supersonic / Daddy’s In The Club

- Despite strong raw saves and playlist adds, intent was diluted (low Save Rate, Replay Ratio, Super %).
- Both tracks leaned heavily on editorial and lacked depth of fan activation.
- Result: algorithmic streams fell away in Week 2, showing scale without commitment cannot sustain growth.

  Being performative, putting on a tougher front that girls have to do and something she’s always done
  > “It’s hard for people to commit to things now, because you’re constantly aware that there might be a better version. People sometimes get so connected to an online picture of themselves that their real self couldn’t match up to… There are all kinds of things that disconnect you from certain parts of reality”

  Likes being on her own, comfortable with the isolation, not having to feel like you’re pleasing everyone on the group 
  did developing as an artist throughout the pandemic influence a more introverted take on dance music?
  > I actually felt the pandemic really helped me! I was never able to spend so much time figuring out sonically what I was and finally had the chance to, under very bizarre circumstances. I did have a lot of teenage angst going on though, just missing out on my ‘prime time’, though looking back I’m pretty grateful because my life’s definitely improved a lot on the other side of the pandemic.

  Tries to keep lyrics ambiguous to keep them open to interpretation 
  Wants gigs to be a safe and relaxed place for people to be themselves, to enjoy and discover new music, no clout chasing 
  Never been a big partier, always associates club culture with danger. Historically too much about getting dressed up and getting drunk. Prefers the more collective element of going out, wants spaces to collaborate in. 
   
  > I always want to stay quite retrospective on music, and I don’t want it to be something that’s always about me specifically. And never getting too in your own ego. So far I’ve done pretty well – ego brushing doesn’t really work for me. I want to keep on that. I just don’t want to become a proper diva

  yunèverse - avatars 
  > Has releasing music under a moniker helped you navigate that transition and separate both of those sides of you?

  > I don’t really see myself as a separate thing to yunè pinku, but it helps you tap into parts [of yourself] that you wouldn’t normally be. I wouldn’t normally be the person on stage, I would naturally be around that rather than in the middle. But if I’m yunè pinku today, I can go out and be that version 

  Safe spaces, route to and from clubs
  > I’ve never been a massive partier, really. But I think that was more because I kind of always associated clubbing and stuff with like, you’re putting yourself in danger

  Daytime prod / collab meet ups ahead of shows
  > But I do like the fact there’s much more independent collectives putting on events now, and opening space for more creatives to all meet each other and potentially collaborate. It’s definitely developing in a positive direction
