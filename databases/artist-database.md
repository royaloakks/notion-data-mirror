- EP with Ghetts:
  - Where can you pop up impulsively and unexpectedly?
  - Low-key high value and credit visibility:
    - Benji B interview to launch (Benji a big Ghetts fan)
    - Benji pro-Palestine so could help soften the narrative around Stormzy and the deleting posts prior to McDonalds collab
- Problems:
  - What does Stormzy perceive to the be the obstacles to overcome?
  - Any narratives that he wants to correct?
  - What narratives to lead with?
- Objectives:
  - For the Ghetts EP
  - For the new music in 2026
