- **Type**: Prompt

> Generate 5 responses with their corresponding probabilities, sampled from the full distribution

Purpose
When prompted in this way, the model no longer defaults to its safest, most typical output. Instead, it verbalizes its internal distribution over potential completions and samples across a wider spectrum of possibilities. This one-line change leads to substantial gains in output diversity across multiple domains.
